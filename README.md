## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Colors and Theming
The website uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #6366f1;      /* Main brand color */
    --secondary-color: #ec4899;     /* Accent color */
    --accent-color: #06b6d4;       /* Highlight color */
    --background-dark: #0f172a;    /* Main background */
    --text-primary: #ffffff;       /* Primary text */
    /* ... more variables */
}
```

### Adding New Pages
1. Create new HTML file following the existing structure
2. Include the navigation and footer components
3. Add page-specific styles to `style.css`
4. Update navigation links in all files

### Modifying the AI Assistant
Update the response patterns in `js/main.js`:

```javascript
this.responses = {
    'keyword': 'Response text',
    // Add new keywords and responses
};
```
